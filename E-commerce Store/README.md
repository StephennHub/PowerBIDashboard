# E-commerce Store

An e-commerce store is a digital platform where customers can browse, purchase, and pay for products or services online.

This dashboard uses two datasets, <a href="https://github.com/StephennHub/PowerBIDashboard/blob/main/E-commerce%20Store/Orders.csv">Orders</a> and <a href="https://github.com/StephennHub/PowerBIDashboard/blob/main/E-commerce%20Store/Details.csv">Details</a>, to visualize store sales performance by product, customer, payment mode, and region.

## Process:

- Data collection involved combining two datasets, Orders and Details, to gather information on sales, products, customers, and regions.
- Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistent formats for accurate analysis.
- Data Merging: To create a unified dataset, the Orders and Details datasets were joined using a common key (such as the Order ID).
- Data Analysis: Determined key metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, and profit; identified top categories, customers, and states.
- Dashboard Visualization: Developed interactive charts and KPIs using tools such as Power BI to present insights.
